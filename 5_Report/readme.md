## Introduction
    The project data logger is a microcontroller based system which takes different parameters and displays the valuable data.
    It will be able to find the dew-point and temperature with the help of temperature and humidity sensor sensor is in contact. 
    It also uses a wind sensor for measuring wind speed.
    
## Research
    It came as an idea to help others with the information to help someone who needs these data like a farm.
    With the help of coding we did our recording work to save your time.
    
    ## 4W's and 1H
    Who: Anyone who has to keep a monitoring system of atmosphere.
    What: User will get the atmospheric parameters.
    When: When the user is having to monitor the atmospheris parameters countinously.
    Where: It can be deployed anywhere where monitoring is required.
    How: User can simply plug the system module to the power supply and it will work.
