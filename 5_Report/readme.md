## Introduction
    The project data logger is a microcontroller based system which takes different parameters and displays the valuable data.
    It will be able to find current consumed by the device sensor sensor is in contact. 
    It changes with the change of current cinsumed.
    
## Research
    It came as an idea to help others with the information to help someone who needs these data.
    With the help of coding we did our recording work to save your time.
    
## 4W's and 1H
    Who: Anyone who has to keep a monitoring system for current.
    What: User will get the current consumed.
    When: When the user is having to monitor the current value countinously.
    Where: It can be deployed anywhere where monitoring is required.
    How: User can simply plug the system module to the power supply and it will work.
