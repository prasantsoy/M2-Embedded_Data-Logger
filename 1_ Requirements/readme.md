# Requirements
## Introduction
    The project data logger is a microcontroller based system which takes different parameters and displays the valuable data.
    It will be able to find current consumed by the device sensor sensor is in contact. 
    It changes with the change of current cinsumed.
    
## Research
    It came as an idea to help others with the information to help someone who needs these data.
    With the help of coding we did our recording work to save your time.
    
## Cost
    It cost little to make this applicaton along with the cost of microsontroller, sensors and displays.
    
## Defining Our System
    The data shown will be current consumed.
    
    Data needed by microcontroller:
    1.Current analog data
    2.Resolution of ADC.
    
    TCurrent is measured with the help of current sensor module. 
    The ADC converts the analog to digital data.
    A display will project the output.
    
## SWOT ANALYSIS
    Strenth
    1. It is a very cheap and efficient system that helps much of manual labour.
    2. It is simplae to use and understand.
    3. All data is projected on the LED display.
    
    Weakness
    1. The data provided is of the current time.
    
    Oppurtinities
    1. Monitoring system.
    2. Small gadgets.
    
    Threats
    1. The sensors are only measures the parameters connected to it.
    2. It only takes one input at a time.

## 4W's and 1H
    Who: Anyone who has to keep a monitoring system for current.
    What: User will get the current consumed.
    When: When the user is having to monitor the current value countinously.
    Where: It can be deployed anywhere where monitoring is required.
    How: User can simply plug the system module to the power supply and it will work.
