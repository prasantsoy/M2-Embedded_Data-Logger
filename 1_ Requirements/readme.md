# Requirements
## Introduction
    The project data logger is a microcontroller based system which takes different parameters and displays the valuable data.
    It will be able to find the dew-point and temperature with the help of temperature and humidity sensor sensor is in contact. 
    It also uses a wind sensor for measuring wind speed.
    


## Research
    It came as an idea to help others with the information to help someone who needs these data like a farm, and with the help of coding we did our recording work to 
    save your time.
    
## Cost
    It cost little to make this applicaton along with the cost of microsontroller, sensors and displays.
    
## Defining Our System
    The data shown will be:
    1.Temperature.
    2.Dew-point.
    3.wind speed.
    
    Data needed by microcontroller:
    1.Temperature
    2.Humidity
    3.Wind speed
    
    Temperature and humidity wil be provided by a single sensor module. 
    Windspeed will be given by the wind speed sensor.
    A display will project the output.
    
## SWOT ANALYSIS
    Strenth
    1. It is a very cheap and efficient system that helps much of manual labour.
    2. It is simplae to use and understand.
    3. All data is projected on the LED display.
    
    Weakness
    1. The data provided is of the current time.
    
    Oppurtinities
    1. Agricultural company
    2. Farms
    
    Threats
    1. The sensors are only measures the parameters within its vicinity.
    2. It in not accurate for a large area.

## 4W's and 1H
    Who: Anyone who has to keep a monitoring system of atmosphere.
    What: User will get the atmospheric parameters.
    When: When the user is having to monitor the atmospheris parameters countinously.
    Where: It can be deployed anywhere where monitoring is required.
    How: User can simply plug the system module to the power supply and it will work.
